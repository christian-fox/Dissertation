## Thermo-tunnel Energy Generation

This was my code from my undergraduate final year dissertation.

A program was written for modelling; potential profile, probability of tunnelling, population distribution and current density integrand inside a vacuum gap between two electrodes while considering how variations in physical factors such as density of states (DOS), temperature gradient and separation would impact total current density in a thermotunnel device.
